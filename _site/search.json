    "text": "Better p-values…kinda\nThe resampling tests above are conservative because they use the total variance to estimate the t-value. What we really want is the variance among the mice, since this is the level that the treatment was applied, and this variance will be smaller than the total variance, so the denominator of the t-value will be smaller, the t-value will be bigger, and the p-value smaller! And we have a huge sample size to estimate this variance precisely.\nThe problem is, we don’t know the variance among the mice because the cells from mice within a treatment were pooled. So let’s model this and computed expected p-values across a range of among-mice variance. The amount of among-mice variance relative to the total variance (among-mice + among-cell) is the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which ranges between zero and one. The further the ICC is from zero, the more correlated (dependent) the errors and the wrong the inference using a naïve test like that of the researchers.\nAlgorithm:\n\nStart with the lowest ICC in a pre-specified list of ICCs that range between 0 and 1\nUse the observed total variance and the ICC to compute the among-mouse (\\(\\sigma^2_\\alpha\\)) and among-cell (\\(\\sigma^2_\\varepsilon\\)) variances\nUse the among-mouse variance and the observed difference between treatment means to create fake mouse means with five mice per treatment and an expected difference between treatment means equal to the observed difference.\nUse the among-cell variance to create 1500 values per mouse (the average number of cells per mouse in the actual experiment) – these values are random “error” around each mouse mean.\nCompute the mean value for each mouse\nDo a t-test\nSave the t-value\nSave the p-value\nRepeat 2-8 2000 times\nCompute the Power of the modified experimental design at the specified ICC using the 2000 p-values\nCompute the expected p-value for this ICC by\n\n\nCompute the mean of the 2000 t-values\nCompute the p-value from the averaged t-value\n\n\nChange the ICC to the next higher ICC in the list and repeat 2-11.\n\n\n\nCode\nt_to_p &lt;- function(t){\n  p &lt;- 2 * pt(-abs(t), df = n * 2 - 2, lower.tail = TRUE)\n  return(p)\n}\n\nset.seed(1)\nn_reps &lt;- 2000\nn &lt;- 5\nn_ss &lt;- 1500\nsigma_total &lt;- summary(m1_teff)$sigma # estimated SD for TEFF\ndelta &lt;- .219 # observed difference for TEFF\nicc_vec &lt;- c(0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75)\nt &lt;- numeric(n_reps)\ntable_out &lt;- data.table(NULL)\n#sigma_a^2: the variance among mice\n#sigma_e^2: the error variance (within mice)\nfor(sim_i in 1:length(icc_vec)){\n  icc &lt;- icc_vec[sim_i]\n  # icc = sigma_a^2/sigma_total^2\n  sigma_a &lt;- sqrt(icc * sigma_total^2)\n  # sigma_total^2 = sigma_a^2 + sigma_e^2\n  sigma_e &lt;- sqrt(sigma_total^2 - sigma_a^2)\n  for(rep_i in 1:n_reps){\n    tngfr_means &lt;- rnorm(n, sd = sigma_a) \n    fox_means &lt;- rnorm(n, sd = sigma_a) + delta \n    # slow\n    tngfr &lt;- rnorm(n * n_ss, mean = rep(tngfr_means, each = n_ss), sd = sigma_e) |&gt;\n      matrix(nrow = n_ss, ncol = n) |&gt;\n      apply(2, mean)\n    fox &lt;- rnorm(n * n_ss, mean = rep(fox_means, each = n_ss), sd = sigma_e) |&gt;\n      matrix(nrow = n_ss, ncol = n) |&gt;\n      apply(2, mean)\n    # fast shortcut since the estimated mean will be so close to true mean\n    # tngfr &lt;- tngfr_means\n    # fox &lt;- fox_means\n\n    t[rep_i] &lt;- t.test(tngfr, fox, var.equal = TRUE)$statistic\n  }\n  p &lt;- t_to_p(t)\n  table_out &lt;- rbind(\n    table_out,\n    data.table(\n      icc = icc,\n      t = mean(t),\n      power = sum(p &lt; 0.05)/n_reps\n    )\n  )\n  \n}\n\n\ntable_out[, p := 2 * pt(t, df = n * 2 - 2, lower.tail = TRUE)]\n\ngg1 &lt;- ggplot(data = table_out,\n              aes(x = icc,\n                  y = p)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_pubr()\ngg2 &lt;- ggplot(data = table_out,\n              aes(x = icc,\n                  y = power)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_pubr()\nplot_grid(gg1, gg2, ncol = 2, labels = \"AUTO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel A shows the expected, statistically valid p-value for the experimental design over a range of among-mouse variation relative to the total variation (the ICC). The modeling suggests that, given the observed difference, a modified experiment with known mouse ID for each cell would rarely observe small p-values unless the ICC were pretty small (less than about 0.25).\nPanel B shows the power of a modified experimental design with known mouse ID given different amounts of among-mouse variation relative to the total variation (the ICC) and using 5% as the significance level. Remember, Power is the probability of observing a p-value less than the set significance level. Typically, researchers want a power of 0.8 or higher to justify the time, cost and animal welfare of an experiment. The modeling suggests that a modified experimental design, with known mouse ID for each cell, and given the observed difference, would require a pretty small ICC (less than 0.15) in order to have good power.\nUnfortunately, we don’t know the actual ICC and it’s hard for me to make a reasonable guess, given my lack of familiarity with these kinds of data.\nAnd remember, the observed difference in expression levels seems kinda small."

Tumour-infiltrating CAR T cells were further purified by sorting human CD3+ TILs from each isolate using a Cytek Aurora Cell Sorter. A total of 20,000 CAR TILs were sorted from each tumour and pooled across five mice per group. Cells were barcoded and sequencing libraries were generated using the 10X Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ v.3.1 kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced at the CHOP High Throughput Sequencing Core on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with an average read depth of 50,000 reads per cell.\nGene set scores for Teff, TRM and Treg cell subtypes were calculated with AddModuleScore (Seurat), using curated gene lists from a previous study58 (Extended Data Fig. 9g–i). AddModuleScore was also used to calculate a per-cell FOXO1 transcriptional activity score, using the top 100 upregulated genes in CD8+ HA.28ζ CAR T cells overexpressing FOXO1 versus tNGFR (Fig. 2)."
