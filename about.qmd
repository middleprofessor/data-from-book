Data From began in 2018 as the name of a project that I used to collect example data sets for my Applied Biostatics class at the University of Southern Maine and for the R Markdown book that I was creating for this class. This book is [Statistics for the Experimental Biologist](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/applied-biostatistics_bookdown/_book/index.html){target="_blank"}.
